# 🏃 Human Activity Recognition with LSTM

A Deep Learning project that recognizes human physical activities using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks. The model learns temporal patterns from sensor data and predicts the activity being performed.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is the process of identifying a person's activity based on data collected from wearable sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.

In this project, an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network is trained on sequential sensor data to classify different human activities with high accuracy.
